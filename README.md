# cardioid-table
A visualization of the cardioid modular multiplication table

Written in Pythonista (an iOS application for writing Python), this program displays the cardioid modular multiplication table at various number of points on the perimeter, modularities, and multiplicative constants.

Emphasis should be placed on the fact that this program will only run in Pythonista, and was written on an iPhone.
